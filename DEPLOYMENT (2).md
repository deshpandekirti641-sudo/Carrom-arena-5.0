# 🚀 Carrom Arena Deployment Guide

## ✅ DEPLOYMENT ISSUES RESOLVED

### The Problem
- **"Exited with status 1"** - Build failures due to lockfile conflicts
- **"Couldn't find package.json in opt/render/project/src"** - Incorrect directory paths
- **"Exited with status 127"** - Missing commands or dependencies

### The Solution
We've implemented comprehensive deployment configurations for ALL major platforms:

## 📁 Deployment Files Created

### Core Build Infrastructure
- **`scripts/build.sh`** - Comprehensive build script that handles lockfile refresh
- **`scripts/deploy.sh`** - Complete deployment automation
- **`package.json`** - Updated with platform-specific build commands

### Platform-Specific Configurations

#### 🟢 **Render** (render.yaml)
- Custom build command using our build script
- Proper environment variables
- Build filters for relevant files

#### 🟢 **Vercel** (vercel.json)
- Optimized for Next.js
- Custom build configuration
- Runtime and memory settings

#### 🟢 **Netlify** (netlify.toml)
- Static site generation support
- Redirect rules for SPA behavior
- Build optimization

#### 🟢 **Railway** (railway.json)
- Nixpacks configuration
- Health check endpoints
- Restart policies

#### 🟢 **Heroku** (Procfile, app.json)
- Process definitions
- Add-on configurations
- Environment variables

## 🔧 Build Script Features

Our `scripts/build.sh` automatically:
1. **Removes outdated lockfiles** (`pnpm-lock.yaml`)
2. **Cleans node_modules** for fresh install
3. **Installs dependencies** with `--no-frozen-lockfile`
4. **Builds the application** using Next.js
5. **Provides detailed logging** for debugging

## 🛠️ How Each Platform Will Deploy

### Render
```bash
chmod +x scripts/build.sh && ./scripts/build.sh
```

### Vercel
```bash
next build
```

### Netlify
```bash
chmod +x scripts/build.sh && ./scripts/build.sh
```

### Railway
```bash
chmod +x scripts/build.sh && ./scripts/build.sh
```

### Heroku
```bash
npm run build
```
